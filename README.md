### About me
Hello! My name is Dhaneswar, and I am passionate about becoming a Data Analyst.
I have a strong background in Python programming, which I actively use for data
manipulation and analysis. Alongside Python, I am proficient in working with 
databases, particularly MySQL, for efficient data extraction and querying.
In terms of data visualization, I have experience using Tableau and Excel to
create insightful dashboards and reports that help communicate data-driven
insights effectively. With a combination of these skills, I am working towards
harnessing data to make informed, strategic decisions and contribute meaningfully
in the field of data analysis.
